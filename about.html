            <p>
                The Commerce Society of Ryan International School, also called the “COMSOC”, was established in the school in the academic-financial year 2021-22, with the aim of providing experience and knowledge to young commercians, aspiring leaders and managers for tomorrow. The need of the situation was to build and train students for financial events, which are very actively organized and conducted by prestigious colleges of University of Delhi and other prominent institutions. These events give a teaser to these young folks about how the trading and business world functions and at the same time, boost their business awareness. Validating all these factors, a specialized and professional body was set up in the School as COMSOC, providing this opportunity to its future entrepreneurs and managers. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Management from the first day of assuming office started with the functioning and training of all its members, building their forte, and providing them a big chance of being a leader.
            </p>

            <p>
                The COMSOC- RIS Rohini has emerged as the standout group and participates in almost every college fest and win accolades, one of the only schools to do so in entire Delhi-NCR region. The goal is to keep moving forward and establish Society’s reputation amongst other colleges in Delhi and circuit.
